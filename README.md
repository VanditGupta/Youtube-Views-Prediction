# YouTube Views Predictor

## Description

YouTube Views Prediction is an innovative tool designed for content creators to estimate the view count of their YouTube videos which will be uploaded in the future. The application utilizes a detailed form where users input various parameters such as channel name, video title, category, and more. This data is then used to forecast the potential performance of the video on YouTube, aiding creators in strategizing their content.

## Features

- **User Input Form:** Detailed form capturing essential information about the video.
- **Predictive Analysis:** Uses input data to predict the future view count of YouTube videos.
- **Interactive Interface:** Easy-to-use web interface for inputting video details.
- **Dynamic Data Processing:** Analyzes various factors like video category, tags, and engagement options.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Offers creators insights into potential video performance.

## Dataset Description

In here datasets are used from: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new)

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Framework:** MobileNet, TensorFlow.js
- **Preprocessing and Model Training:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, using IBM Watson for advanced machine learning capabilities
- **Prediction Engine:** IBM Watson for generating accurate and reliable video view predictions

## Running the Application

To getting up and running the Dataset_Creation.ipynb file you have to download USVideos.csv file from [USVideos.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new?select=USvideos.csv) and add it to the datasets folder.
